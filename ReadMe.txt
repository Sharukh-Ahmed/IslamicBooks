# 📚 Islamic Books

**Live Site:** [https://islamic-books.vercel.app/](https://islamic-books.vercel.app/)

Islamic Books is a modern, full-featured Islamic book store built to share and sell classical Islamic knowledge in both English and Arabic.

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

* 📌 **Full-Stack Capable**: While only the frontend is live now, I’m actively building a robust backend with Node.js and Express.
* 🔐 **Authentication in Progress**: Working on secure login and role-based access control.
* 💳 **Real Payments**: Stripe integration for real book purchases is in progress.
* 🛒 **Real-World Functionality**: From shopping cart to seller uploads, it mimics a real e-commerce platform.
* 📈 **Scalable Architecture**: Designed as a monorepo to separate frontend/backend concerns and support future microservices.
* 📘 **Mission-Driven**: Beyond technical goals, the project serves a purpose — spreading timeless Islamic knowledge.
* 🧠 **Self-Learned & Built From Scratch**: Demonstrates my ability to independently build a production-ready application using the MERN stack.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

* 🔧 **Backend API** *(in progress)* – Node.js/Express backend to manage books, orders, sellers, and users.
* 🔐 **Secure Authentication & Role-Based Access** *(in progress)* – Login and registration system with seller/user roles.
* 💳 **Stripe Payment Integration** *(in progress)* – Accept secure payments for book purchases.
* 🧾 **Order History & Invoices** – Allow users to track purchases and download receipts.
* 🧠 **Advanced Search Filters** – Search by author, category, language, and tags (currently supports book name).
* 📦 **Enhanced Seller Dashboard** – Expand existing `/seller` panel with analytics, order management, inventory alerts, and earnings reports.
* 📘 **Book Previews/Readers** – Enable in-browser reading with pagination and bookmarking.
