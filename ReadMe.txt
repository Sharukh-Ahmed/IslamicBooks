📚 Islamic Books

Live Site: https://islamic-books.vercel.app/

Built By: Sharukh Ahmed

Summary:
Islamic Books is a full-stack, production-ready web application that provides access to a growing collection of classical Islamic literature in both English and Arabic. It features a dynamic catalog, seller dashboard, cart system, and search — built with modern technologies and scalability in mind. Currently under active development with backend and Stripe integration in progress.

## 💼 Why This Project Stands Out

✅ Built for Real Use: Not just a demo — this project solves a real-world problem with real users in mind.

🔧 Backend in Progress: Full Express backend under construction with user/book/order management.

💳 Stripe Integration (in progress): Will support secure payments for digital/physical books.

🔐 Secure & Role-Aware: Login for users and sellers, with route protection (in progress).

🚀 Scalable Design: Modular codebase with separate folders for frontend/backend — easy to expand to microservices.

🌍 Mission-Driven: Spreading beneficial Islamic knowledge, not just building for tech's sake.

🧠 Self-Taught Developer: Demonstrates my ability to learn fast, build full-stack apps independently, and solve problems end-to-end.
